# Verilog Practice

This repository contains a collection of Verilog projects that are designed to help beginners get started with Verilog. These projects were developed by [Myrausman](https://github.com/Myrausman) as part of my own learning process, and are shared here in the hopes that they will be useful to others.

## Requirements

To use these projects, you will need a Verilog simulator. Some popular options include:

- [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)
- [ModelSim](https://www.mentor.com/company/higher_ed/modelsim-student-edition)
- [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html)
